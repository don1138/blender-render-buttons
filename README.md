### Blender Add-on That Provides Quick Access to Render Controls

A Blender 3.0 compatablity update of **Blender2.8x-RenderButton** v0.0.2 by [Mitsuma](https://github.com/Mitsuma/Blender2.8-RenderButton), which I later realized was pointless when I noticed that the 0.0.3 version of that add-on was already compatable with Blender 3.0.

## Installation

Download the latest ZIP from **Releases**.

Install via ``Edit > Preferences > Add-ons > Installâ€¦``.
