### Blender Add-on That Provides Quick Access to Render Controls

Shamelessly adapted from **Blender 2.80 Render Buttons** mods made by [Mitsuma](https://github.com/Mitsuma/Blender2.8-RenderButton) and [Olaf Haag](https://github.com/OlafHaag/Blender2_80beta_RenderButtons).

Updated to be compatable with Blender 3.0.

## Installation
